## Scope Of Work
## Getting Started
- As usual, either copy the git and clone to you preferred directory, or download the .zip file.
- Ive created bash scripts to make running this project easy. From the root directory (same level as `pom.xml`):
    
  ````
   $ cd bin
   ````
   To package the .jar file, run:
   ````
   $ bash package.sh
   ````
   To view the contents of the .jar (optional):
   ````
   $ bash view.sh
   ````
   To run the .jar file, run
   ````
   $ bash run.sh
   ````
